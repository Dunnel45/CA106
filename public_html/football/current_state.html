             <h3>Lifestyle and money</h3>
             <p>When football first started it wasn't even considered a career nevermind being paid.<br> Players of the game first started being compensated on the 20/July/1885 when the FA legalised pay.<br> Nowadays the players earn superfluous money, for example the Argentinian player Lionel Messi earns a salary of 40M EUR.<br> In the past footballers would earn the same wage as the fans watching them, nowdays the money the fans earn and the players make is incomparable.<br> Up until the 1960s couldn't earn more than 20 pound a week.<br> Modern era players are influenced on what club to play with etc. by money however in the past it was just passion for the game.<br> Footballers are now treated like celebrities due to the amount of money they are earning, this could be killing the love for the game.</p>

             <h3>Changes in the game</h3>
             <p>There has been lots of changes in Football during the years.<br> The pace of the modern game has been altered, todays game is much faster than the older styles of football.<br> Matches are now more intense, with players sprinting much more than they used to due to a more aggressive style of counter attacking play.<br> Techonlogical advances has brought new opportunities into the the world of soccer.<br>
             For example goal line technology is now implemented into the game.<br> This determines whether the whole of the ball has crossed the goal line.<br> This ensures the referees decision is correct and reduces arguments on whether a goal should stand or not.</p>
