				<p>Horse racing has been taking place in the UK and Ireland for hundreds of years. Chester is  the oldest racecourse in the UK and it dates back to the sixteenth century.</p>
				<p>Horse racing is split into two divisions “flat racing” and “jump racing”.</p>
				<p>The flat race season normally runs from April to October and the jump season from October to late April. The seasons are not strict and since the introduction of All Weather race tracks we can enjoy flat racing all year round.</p> 
				<p>These days jump racing is popular in the middle of summer as well as the ground is dry, and waterlogging is less common.	</p>
				<br>
				<p>Flat racing features some of the world’s most famous races. Horses run on the flat course from the age of two. It’s uncommon for a flat horse to continue running past the age of six, and very rare for them to still be racing when they hit double figures. A flat horse tends to peak at four or five years old. </p>
				<p>Most horses start in jump racing at the age of three or four and progress through the ranks. They’ll start in bumper races ( a Flat race run under the rules of Jump racing , followed by a season of hurdling after which they either continue  hurdle racing or move onto bigger fences. A hurdler’s best years are between the ages of five to seven.</p>

                <h2>Horse Racing Facts</h2>
					<p>The average racehorse lives for around 30 years, but they usually retire around the age of 15. No horse over the age of 18 has won any races.</p>
					<p>The fastest speed recorded for a horse was 55mph. Even the fastest humans can only run about 28 mph.</p>
					<p> Horse racing is one of the world's oldest sports and can be traced back to the chariot races of the Roman Empire.</p>
					<p>There was once a British racehorse called “Humourist”. After winning The Derby in 1921—England’s richest horse race—it was discovered that he was suffering from tuberculosis and had effectively been racing with just one healthy lung.</p>
