	<h2>Tradition</h2>
	<article id="main-col">
		<div class="tradition">
				<p>
					In the introductory section we mentioned that MMA is simply the mixing of at least two martial arts, one striking and one grappling.
					This is not a new idea in the slightest, “Pankration” was an olympic sport in ancient greece which combined boxing and wrestling.
					 Ancient china also had “Lei tai” a sport similar to pankration.Egypt, Japan and India are all noted to have similar histories in this regard.
				</p>
				<p>
					 However as time past the need to know these martial arts lessened.
					 The improved weaponry used in wars almost completely replaced the original use of martial arts in combat.
					 In the western world boxing grew in popularity as a sport and was eventually refined into the sport we know today, and in America specifically freestyle and greco-roman wrestling grew to be a staple of high schools and colleges. 
					 However in the east, specifically Asia the tradition of martial arts thrived far more. To this day China still has temples full of monks who practice martial arts. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The “rebirth” of martial arts in the western world is actually owed majorly to Hollywood. Actors like Jean-Claude Van Damme, and Chuck Norris had a huge impact on how martial arts were seen in the western world.
					But Bruce Lee was probably the most impactful. While his movies had a similar impact to people like Norris and Van Damme, what he did off the screen was more important.
					Lee developed his own martial art called “Jeet-Kune Do”  which was a mix of different martial arts Lee had trained in.
					These Hollywood martial arts movies helped popularize the idea of martial arts in the western world.

			<h2>Sports</h2>
				<p>
					The premise of combat as a spectator sport is nothing new, as we covered in the last section with sports like Pankration.
					However in the past century specifically there have been many sports across the globe that have greatly lended to MMA as we know it today.
				</p>
				<p>
					Vale Tudo was a sport developed in Brazil in the 1920’s.
					A Japanese Judo practitioner named Mitsuyo Maeda immigrated to Brazil in the early 1900’s.
					While there he became friends with Gastão Gracie and eventually taught Gastão’s kids Carlos and Helio judo. 
					The brothers developed the ground fighting elements of judo into Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.They then opened a school in Rio de Janeiro and issued an open challenge to take on all comers in an “anything goes”(Vale Tudo in portuguese) match. 
					This eventually developed into the second biggest spectator sport in Brazil and was had to be held in football stadiums due to its popularity.
				</p>
				<p>
					Shoot wrestling(or shooto) is a japanese sport derived from sambo, muay thai, jiu-jitsu, judo, and catch-as-you-can wrestling.
					It was created in 1983 by a japanese pro wrestler and heavily resembles modern mma.
					The famous Pride FC organisation was heavily influenced by the sport and Pride is one of the first big mma organisations. The organisation is credited for popularising mma in japan and to a lesser extent the rest of the world. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The UFC(Ultimate Fighting Championship) is currently the most famous MMA organisation in the world.
					It was created in 1993 and was created by Rorion Gracie a grandson of Helio Gracie, who was responsible for Vale Tudo.
					It was based around a similar concept to the Jean-Claude Van Damme movie “Bloodsport”. 
					The concept was that 8 people would fight in a tournament to prove whose martial art was the best.
					The contestants included a boxer, wrestler, karateka etc.
					But the winner was Royce Gracie a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioner and also a grandson of Helio. 
					Royce was the smallest man in the tournament and the Gracies chose him to compete due to this.
					They wanted to show how effective their martial art was. 
					This event caused the sport to rapidly gain popularity in America and eventually evolved into MMA as we know it today.

			<h2>Public Reception</h2>
				<p>
				Public reception varied greatly from country to country. 
				In Japan Pride was a loved and respected organisation, as were many other MMA organisations such as Pancrase(named after the greek sport). 
				However in many western countries such as the USA and Ireland the sport was labeled as “human cock-fighting”. 
				This caused problems for organisations like the UFC as many states banned the sport.
				It has been an uphill battle for many organisations in the western world to make the sport respected.
				For example New York only legalised the sport in 2016, and connecticut in 2013.
