		<h2>Global Popularity</h2>
		<article id="main-col">
			<div class="global">
					<p>
						MMA is currently the fastest growing sport in the world. 
						It’s popularity has exploded in the USA over the last 13 years since the first season of the ultimate fighter reality TV show in 2005.
						This show created by the UFC helped to humanise the fighters and saved the UFC from bankruptcy. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The sport is also growing extremely quickly in Asia thanks to One Championship.
						Recently the first legal MMA event was held in Thailand, and many Asian countries other than Japan have started to watch the sport.
					</p>
					<p>
						One other area of growth for the sport is Europe.
						The UFC has seen an explosion of European stars in the forms of Conor McGregor, Darren Till,  and Joanna Jedrzejczyk among others.
						This has caused a massive growth of interest in both the UFC and other MMA organisations in Europe.
					</p>
			</div>
			<div class="organisations">
				<h2>Organisations</h2>
					<p>
						Without a doubt the most popular MMA organisation in the world is the UFC. 
						The organisation has acquired most of its competitors such as Pride, WEC(World Extreme Cagefighting), and Strikeforce.
						This has also given them access to what is considered to be easily the best roster of fighters on the planet.
					</p>
					<p>
						However the UFC isn't the biggest organisation in Asia.
						One Championship is a singapore based promotion that has the largest amount of market share in Asia.
						It is an anomaly as it is the only organisation in the world that can match the UFC in popularity, albeit only in Asia.
					</p>
					<p>
						Another notable organisation is Bellator.
						Bellator is an organisation that is trying to compete with the UFC’s stranglehold on the western market, specifically in the US.
						Its president is scott coker, the creator of strikeforce which is one of the organisations the UFC acquired and arguably got some of their best fighters from.
						Despite this Bellator has not made a huge impact on the UFc’s market share, although they have become a popular organisation in their own right.
					</p>
			</div>
			<div class="fighters">
				<h2>Fighters</h2>
					<p>
						The UFC has the best roster of fighters in the world as of now. 
						There are 8 male weight divisions in the UFC and 4 female divisions.
						The divisions and their champions as of December 2018 are ....
					</p>
					<div class="table">

					<p>
						In MMA there are also the pound for pound rankings.
						These are essentially how it is projected that the fighters in all weight classes would be ranked if they weighed the same,
						Skill,athleticism, and level of talent are all taken into account.
